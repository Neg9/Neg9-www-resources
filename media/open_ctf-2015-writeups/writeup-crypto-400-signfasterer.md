# SignFasterer Solution

SignFaster is a challenge from OpenCTF. It's an RSA challenge that forces you to prove your understanding of RSA's stranger features. If you'd like to test your mettle, don't read any of the three solutions, the second of which is below. Download the challenge tarball and learn about a very difficult and interesting flaw in RSA.

The client is a very simple CTF tcp client that solves a proof of work (using scrypt), then transmits an RSA public key, and finally solves a challenge involving 1337 RSA signatures. The design of the challenge is very good because it tells you if you get it right without requiring you to get the speed correct. That means if you have a solution that is 2 seconds too slow but you don't know if it works, you can test it and make sure that you didn't goof. Two bugs in the challenge were: the public key size validator required public keys that were 4096 bits or more which means a key of 4094 bits won't work when it's a perfectly valid 4096-bit key (RSA is more liberal about key sizes so long as you're in the general area), and the use of twisted python library made the challenge less reliable than it should have been. Both of these were easily overcome.

The client they gave us takes about 40 seconds to compute the signature which is very slow. They want you to submit a solution in less than a second. Even with a fast implementation (which pycrypto is not), it's not easy to make one thousand, three hundred thirty-seven 4096-bit signatures fast. Unlike SignFaster, SignFasterer does not accept solutions with a large encryption exponent e (>= 2**32). This means you can't use the method I used in SignFaster.

The library [four1c2.py](https://github.com/Neg9/Neg9-www-resources/blob/master/media/open_ctf-2015-writeups/resources/four1c2.py) is the central part of the solution. The reason for foul naming of the class is because using this in any system is a horrible weakness and should never be used for any reason, especially not performance. [fasterer.py](https://github.com/Neg9/Neg9-www-resources/blob/master/media/open_ctf-2015-writeups/resources/open_ctf-2015-crypto-400-signfasterer.py) and [four1c2.py](https://github.com/Neg9/Neg9-www-resources/blob/master/media/open_ctf-2015-writeups/resources/four1c2.py) both use an unnecessary library gnfs1.py which I am not releasing due to code quality. It provides a list of possible primes using a sieve.
The library [four1c2.py](https://github.com/Neg9/Neg9-www-resources/blob/master/media/open_ctf-2015-writeups/resources/four1c2.py) provides fuckedRSA, a class that is able to compute Chinese Remainder Theorem quickly with an arbitrary number of primes. A discussion of how CRT works is below (same as the solution from signfaster).

    Say you have the primes [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15] as your prime factors. N is 3*5*7*11*13*15 = 225225.
    The decryption exponent d is computed from the encryption exponent e and phi which is a combination of the prime factors.
    phi = (p-1)*(q-1)*...
    In the example phi = 2*4*6*10*12*14 = 80640
    Let's say that e = 31
    d = inverse(e, phi)
    In this case, d would be 62431, a large number compared to N.
    Encryption works like this:
    ciphertext = pow(plaintext, e, N)
    Let's say our ciphertext is 110138.
    Then the decryption occurs like:
    plaintext = pow(ciphertext, d, N)
    In this case plaintext = 1337.
    In math notation:
    plaintext = (ciphertext ^ d) mod N

This is an expensive method of decrypting (or signing which is the same operation in RSA) a piece of data.
The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that you can compute the decryption with much lower exponents (and thus faster) by splitting the decryption into multiple parts and combining.
```python
    Compute:
    q_inv = Crypto.Util.number.inverse(q, p)
    m_1 = pow(ct, d_P, p)
    m_2 = pow(ct, d_Q, q)
    h = (q_inv*(m_1-m_2)) % p
    m = m_2 + h * q
```

    The d_P for each factor can be computed as d mod (p-1) where p is a factor.
    The set of d_P for our example would be [1, 3, 1, 1, 7, 5].
    q_inv is the inverse of q (the second prime) mod p.
    The first q_inv is inverse(3, 5) = 2.

The solution required a lot of iteration and I was concerned that it wouldn't solve it before the competition was over. A failed attempt to improve speed was brute force of e to get a lower d value, but that saves maybe 10% time. The major improvement over the signfaster solution was using [gmpy2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2). [gmpy2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2) is perhaps 50 or 100 times faster than Python's pow function or the Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.sign function. If you're ever using those, you should know how slow they are.

The winning solution was this:
