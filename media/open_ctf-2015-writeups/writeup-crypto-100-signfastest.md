# SignFastest Solution

Reid provided the insight that allowed this unintended solution.

SignFaster is a challenge from OpenCTF. It's an RSA challenge that forces you to prove your understanding of RSA's stranger features. If you'd like to test your mettle, don't read any of the three solutions, the third of which is below. Download the challenge tarball and learn about an interesting flaw in RSA.

The organizers had found and patched this bug during testing, but pushed a vulnerable version to the competition server without testing. This is a very realistic scenario and shows how you should always test obvious attacks.

In RSA, decryption and signing is a slow process due to the large decryption exponent. By making the decryption exponent small, you weaken encryption and signing done using that key, making it trivial for an attacker to compromise the private key. Therefore it should never be done in practice. In this CTF, though it is done to solve a challenge.

Modify the client to use an encryption exponent of 1. e = 1.  
This makes the decryption exponent equal 1. d = 1.  
This means the pow() in sign() is exponent 1, very easy and fast.

In do_pubkey:
```python
        p, q = Crypto.Util.number.getPrime(2048), Crypto.Util.number.getPrime(2048)
        e = 1
        N = p*q
        d = Crypto.Util.number.inverse(e, (q-1)*(p-1))
        self.rsa = RSA.construct((long(N), long(e), long(d), long(p),
        long(q)))
        pub = self.rsa.publickey()
        self.state = 'challange'
        self.sendLine(b64e(pub.exportKey(format='DER')))
```
